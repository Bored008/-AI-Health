**AI Health** is a secure web application that empowers users to analyze food images using their own personal AI quota. By leveraging Google's Gemini API via OAuth, users can get detailed nutrition breakdowns without relying on a shared developer key or paid subscription.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

AI Health operates on a **"Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK)** model via seamless OAuth integration.

1.  **Secure Login**: You sign in with your Google Account.
2.  **Permission Grant**: A specific scope request is made to access the Gemini API on your behalf.
3.  **Encrypted Storage**: Your session tokens are encrypted (AES-256-GCM) and stored in our secure **Postgres Database**.
4.  **AI Analysis**: When you analyze an image:
    *   The app retrieves your secure token.
    *   The image is processed by **Google Gemini** using your free tier quota.
    *   Results are instantly cached to prevent faster loading next time.
